MORE INFO:
  A full capture of DNS traffic for the last 30 seconds is 
  constantly updated to:
  /home/elf/snort.log.pcap
  
  You can also test your snort rule by running:
  snort -A fast -r ~/snort.log.pcap -l ~/snort_logs -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
  This will create an alert file at ~/snort_logs/alert
  
  This sensor also hosts an nginx web server to access the last 5 minutes worth of pcaps for offline analysis.   These can be viewed by logging into:

HINT: 
  Malware authors often user dynamic domain names and 
  IP addresses that change frequently within minutes or even 
  seconds to make detecting and block malware more difficult.
  As such, its a good idea to analyze traffic to find patterns
  and match upon these patterns instead of just IP/domains.
